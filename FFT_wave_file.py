# step 1 define function for generating a waveform from a given parameters

# step 2 use function to generate mixed sample and save as waveform file

# step 3 calculate FFT of generated waveform 

# step 4 check by subtraction of the FT's that the algorithmically generated FFT
# and the FFT from waveform analysis are the same
